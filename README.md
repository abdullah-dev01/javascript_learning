# JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This repo serves as a collection of all my JavaScript exercises, projects, and notes as I master the **core 20% of JavaScript** that will allow me to build functional web applications.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository is dedicated to my JavaScript learning journey, where I document everything I learn, from basic syntax to advanced concepts. The goal is to build a strong foundation and create real-world applications using JavaScript by following an **80-20 rule-based roadmap**.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- ✅ **Week 1**: JavaScript Basics (Variables, Data Types, Operators)
- ✅ **Week 2**: Functions & Control Flow (Conditionals, Loops, Scope)
- ✅ **Week 3**: Arrays & Objects (Manipulation, Iteration, Methods)
- ✅ **Week 4**: DOM Manipulation & Events (Selecting Elements, Event Listeners)
- ✅ **Week 5**: Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await, Fetch API)
- ✅ **Week 6**: ES6+ Features (Destructuring, Spread/Rest, Error Handling)
- ✅ **Projects**: Build 5 projects of increasing difficulty (To-Do List, Quiz App, Weather Dashboard, Expense Tracker, Chat App)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (for backend basics in Week 5)
- HTML & CSS (for frontend integration in DOM-related projects)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)
- Browser DevTools (for debugging)

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Aligned Topics Covered** with the weekly structure of your roadmap.
2. **Added Weekly Folders** (`week-1`, `week-2`, etc.) to organize exercises based on the roadmap.
3. **Updated Goals & Roadmap** to reflect the focus on mastering core concepts and completing projects.
4. Removed advanced topics like "Modules, Closures, Prototypes" since they are not part of your initial roadmap.
5. Simplified the project structure to match the progression of your learning plan.
