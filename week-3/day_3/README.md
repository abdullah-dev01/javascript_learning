### Day 3: DOM Manipulation

On Day 3, we focused on understanding and working with the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the elements of a webpage. JavaScript provides an API to interact with the DOM, allowing us to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of a web page. Here are some key concepts we covered:

- **Selecting Elements**: Using methods like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.
- **Modifying Content**: Changing text and HTML content dynamically.
- **Handling Events**: Adding event listeners to respond to user actions.
- **Manipulating Styles**: Changing CSS styles using JavaScript.

By mastering these techniques, we can create interactive and dynamic web applications.
